- Install the following libraries before running the code (if not running on Google Colab)
- pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy

- Dataset downloaded from Kaggle (top10k-tmdb-movies.csv) and took the first 501 rows of data for current run

- How to run?
- I have used Google Colab for faster results instead of depending on my local machine. You can use either Google Colab, or Jupyter Notebook. (Preferrably Google Colab). I have bifurcated the functions to each cell following proper coding standards and code readability.

- Originally the code took a little over 2 minutes to run with 500 rows of data using BERT(used for better accuracy). Trimmed the video to showcase the results.

- Salary Expectation
After conducting thorough research on the current market trends and taking into account the significance of the role, I have found that the average salary for a similar position in the USA is around $35/hour for a 40-hour workweek. Should I be selected for the role, I am open to engaging in a constructive discussion to reach a mutually agreeable compensation package.
